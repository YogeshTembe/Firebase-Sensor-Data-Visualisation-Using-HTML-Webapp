## Sensor Data Acquisition
>The data acquired from IOT devices is uploaded on the firebase in the following format
>date: "yyyy-mm-dd" | time: "hours:minutes" | reading: number

After uploading data to firebase we can make http request to firebase to get the data and plot the corresponding readings as per the date provided.
